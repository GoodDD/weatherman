# Weatherman
 
### 1. Any assumptions you made that were not clearly written in the task description

##### The only assumptions that i made where about the routing in the app. Because i thought that i can't put everything on one page. But i didn't implement all the features so one page was enought for me.

### 2. How to deploy/run your solution (Someone who knows nothing about the solution should be able to deploy it using your instructions)

#### To deploy my solution you need:

1. Download or clone sources from this repository to your workspace.
2. From weatherman-frontend folder open command line and run `ng serve` to deploy a local server on `http://localhost:4200/` where frontend part is.
3. Backend part is easy to deploy with `intellij idea`, just open weatherman-backend folder and press `SHIFT+F10` or just click run button.
4. Profit!!!

### 3. How you solved the tasks, and how much time did different parts take

##### Everything was hard at the beginning. Angular and Spring were a new stack of technologies for new so it took quate a lot of time to understand basic concepts. At first i decided what i want to do at the start backend or frontend, then i looked for docs or guides that provided me the basics. I separetad the project by different parts, it was `backend` `input form`, `forecast table` and `interactable map`. All parts together took something about 24 hours of pure coding+learning in total. 

### 4. How you decided what to implement and what to skip

##### I implemented 1 and 2 stage, because in my oppinion with this implementions, this app is looks like an app that can be used by the user.

### 5. What were the biggest challenges and how did you overcome them

##### The biggest challenges were new techologies, i didn't used Angular and Spring before and also had dificulties with styling. For techology dificulties i used official documentains and sometimes watched some guides on youtube. For styling i used solutions from `angular@/flex-layout` and `angular@/material` libraries.

### 6. If there was a problem you did not have time to overcome, describe how you think it could be solved with more time

##### There are a lot of thing that can be done to improve the app. Sould be added validators for the `input form`, from the UI/UX side app can be much more prettier. All stages can be implemented to provide more functionality.

### 7. What did you learn from implementing the project.

##### I learned a lot. This project offerd me an opportunity to learn fullstack-dev and technologies like Angular and Spring boot. I learned how create a fullstack app, that can communicate with 3d-party sources, get data from them wia API and show this data to user. Unfortunately didn't had time to implement database.
